# Git-Gurus-Project
# Representing Progress
My name's Stephen Doe-lawson. I joined git gurus to gain more ideas for projects and maintain a competitive nature though collaborating with others and sharing ideas. I'm open to learning and I want to build myself as a programmer.
I'm ready to learn and an active contributor. I'm lookig forward to contributing with y'all.
