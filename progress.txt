So far, I have learned the following in Git:

1. **Version Control**: I know that Git is a distributed version control system that helps track changes in source code during software development.

2. **Repositories**: A Git repository is a storage space where your project lives. It can be local to a directory on your computer or a remote repository hosted on a server.

3. **Commits**: A commit is a snapshot of your repository at a specific point in time. Each commit has a unique ID and contains a message describing the changes made.

4. **Branches**: Branches allow you to work on different versions of a project simultaneously. The `main` branch is the default branch, and you can create new branches for features or bug fixes.

5. **Merging**: Merging is the process of combining changes from different branches into one. This is often done when a feature branch is ready to be integrated into the main branch.

6. **Cloning**: Cloning a repository means creating a copy of a remote repository on your local machine. This allows you to work on the project locally.

7. **Pull and Push**: Pulling updates your local repository with changes from a remote repository, while pushing sends your local changes to the remote repository.

8. **Staging Area**: The staging area is where you prepare changes before committing them. You can add files to the staging area using the `git add` command.

9. **Basic Commands**:
    - `git init`: Initializes a new Git repository.
    - `git clone`: Clones an existing repository.
    - `git add`: Adds changes to the staging area.
    - `git commit`: Commits changes to the repository.
    - `git status`: Shows the status of changes in the working directory and staging area.
    - `git push`: Pushes changes to a remote repository.
    - `git pull`: Pulls changes from a remote repository.
So far this is my progress in git.
